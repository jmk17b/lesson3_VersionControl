## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A version control server is a server dedicated to solving the problem of file sharing. These allow you and others to edit files and use previous saves to see how the code has been changed over time. They also allow for you to combine old files to take bits and pieces from different saves that you have.
2. The history of Github revolves around the Linux kernel system and a commercial company that developed a proprietary DVCS calledBitkeeper. When relations between the two companys began to detiriorate the Linux development community started to develop a new progam based on what they had learned thus far, this was the creation of Github. This is important to this class beause it shows the kind of attitude a person needs to have to be succesful in this field.
3. A Git repository is an essential part of any program. There are two ways to make a repository. The first way is taking a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turning it into a Git repository. The second way to make is by cloning an existing Git repository from elsewhere. This is important to our class because it is an mandoatory part for using applicaitons like Github in your program.
